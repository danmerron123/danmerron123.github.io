I am a DevOps Engineer with 2 years experience in Windows & Linux Scripting and Automation using Python, Bash and Powershell. I am keen to continue to improve my scripting skills with a 'automate everything' mentality. I will be updating this blog regularly with my scripts and descriptions of their use cases.
